Celery application configuration.

This module sets up a Celery instance that the FastAPI app and
background workers can share.  The broker and result backend are
configured to use Redis, which is provided as a separate service
via docker-compose.  The ``task_track_started`` flag enables
progress reporting for longâ€‘running tasks.
